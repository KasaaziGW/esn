                    ESN is a community platform that can be used by people in different times of emergency.
                    When an emergency occurs, a member of the community/citizen can post on the platform and anyone who is near to them can render help such as <em>first aid, </em>
                    or <em>calling for more help nearby.</em>
                    The community has ordinary users also known as <em>citizens,</em> <em>coordinators</em> who are leaders at different levels that can follow up on these emergency cases,
                    and <em>administrators</em> who are in charge of assigning different previleges to the system's users as well as performing other system administration tasks.
